## A Conversation with A Large Language Model About Programming Languages
- Large Langugae Model (LLM) used: [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app) (AI chatbot developed by Google)

1. I started my conversation with Gemini with the questions: "How do programming languages get created? And what makes them official enough to be used in technology?" I have been curious about this as someone who studies a field that is heavily reliant on programming languages. Gemini tells me that, "There's no formal process or organization that officially recognizes or endorses programming languages. However, a language can become widely accepted and used if it solves a real problem, it is easy to learn and use, it has a strong community, it is supported by tools and libraries, and it has real-world applications." This deviates from the topic of programming languages but the answer from Gemini reminds me of how many things in life do not have an "official stamp" for it to be wide respected in terms of its respective fields.

2. Curious to how a respected programming language came to be, I asked Gemini: "Can you give me an example of these steps with a language that has been created in the past and is now widely used?" Gemini responds with a bulleted list of how Python came to be: "Conceptualization, Syntax and Semantics, Compiler or Interpreter, Libraries and Tools, Testing and Refinement, and Community and Adoption." Gemini tells me that Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer, created Python in the 1980s with the goal of creating a programming language that is easy to learn for beginners. Adhering to its intended goal, Python's syntax is simple and readible. Python also does not require a compiler. Gemini's thorough yet short answer has allowed me to understand why Python has become so popular in just six or so bullet points.

3. I wanted to pivot the discussion a bit and ask an opinionated question to Gemini to see what kind of answer would be generated. "Should AI generated art be considered and judged the same as traditional art?" I asked this question because while AI relates to programming languages, I like how this question aims to connect to a seemingly oppisite audience of art. Gemini produced two answers, one for each argument:
    - Arguments for AI-generated art being considered the same: it possesses creativity, skill, and expression.
    - Arguments against AI-generated art being considered the same: it lacks a human element, intention, and ownership.
These answers from Gemini allow me to understand that many LLM have a responsibility to be unbiased and simple provide information. It makes me wonder if there are any LLM that are opinionated, and if they do not exist yet, could it be a possibility.

4. To continue my discussion with Gemini, I asked: "Do you have any academic references to support either side?" Gemeni recommended me these resources:
    - Supporting the Idea of AI-Generated Art as Equivalent to Traditional Art:
        - "Generative Art: A Beginner's Guide" by Matt Pearson: This book provides a comprehensive introduction to generative art, including AI-generated art, and argues for its artistic value.
    - Supporting the Idea of AI-Generated Art as Distinct from Traditional Art:
        - "The Art of Artificial Intelligence: A Philosophical Inquiry" by Mark Coeckelbergh: This book examines the philosophical implications of AI-generated art and argues that it raises questions about the nature of creativity and human agency.
When trying to verify these sources online, I was not able to find them. I tried searching using different phrasing but these sources did not appear. However, I was able to find other similar sources by those authors. It seems that LLM (maybe specifically just Gemini) might not be great at giving exact sources, but they can guide you in the correct direction. Here are the sources I found by the authors provided by Gemini:
    - "Generative Art: A Practical Guide Using Processing" by Matt Pearson. This book encourages generative art by teaching the reader how to produce their own generative art. The book claims it is not teaching the reader how to be an artist though, because being an artist goes beyond creating generative art.
    - "Can Machines Create Art?" by Mark Coeckelbergh. This journal generates discussion about machines creating are by asking questions like "What is art creation? What do we mean by art? And, what do we mean by machines create art?". It does not necessarily have a clear stance on the subject, but it rather challenges to define what art is and what a machine is.

## TL;DR
1. **Question 1**: How do programming languages get created? And what makes them official enough to be used in technology?
    - **Gemini's Answer**: "There's no formal process or organization that officially recognizes or endorses programming languages. However, a language can become widely accepted and used if it solves a real problem, it is easy to learn and use, it has a strong community, it is supported by tools and libraries, and it has real-world applications."
2. **Question 2**: "Can you give me an example of these steps with a language that has been created in the past and is now widely used?"
    - **Gemini's Answer**: A detailed bulleted list about Python that focuses on "Conceptualization, Syntax and Semantics, Compiler or Interpreter, Libraries and Tools, Testing and Refinement, and Community and Adoption."
3. **Question 3**: Should AI generated art be considered and judged the same as traditional art?
    - **Gemini's Answer**:
        - Arguments for AI-generated art being considered the same: it possesses creativity, skill, and expression.
        - Arguments against AI-generated art being considered the same: it lacks a human element, intention, and ownership.
4. **Question 4**: Do you have any academic references to support either side?
    - **Gemini's Answer (could not find these sources online, not sure if they exist)**:
        - Supporting the Idea of AI-Generated Art as Equivalent to Traditional Art:
            - "Generative Art: A Beginner's Guide" by Matt Pearson.
        - Supporting the Idea of AI-Generated Art as Distinct from Traditional Art:
            - "The Art of Artificial Intelligence: A Philosophical Inquiry" by Mark Coeckelbergh.

## Conclusion
Although having a conversation with a LLM is not the same as having one with another human, it does serve to help stimulate the brain in a similar way. I found myself generating more curiousities and questions as I asked the LLM more questions.
