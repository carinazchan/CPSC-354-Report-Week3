- I started with the question "What is a programming language?" Although it seems like the most obvious and simple question, I was really curious as to how a LLM would answer it and what other topics it would lead to. I also wanted to ask this question because I wanted to remind myself of where my knowledge used to be before starting my studies here at Chapman University; before I knew what a programming language was.
