## A Conversation with A Large Language Model About Programming Languages
- Large Langugae Model (LLM) used: Gemini (AI chatbot developed by Google)

1. I started my conversation with Gemini with the questions: "How do programming languages get created? And what makes them official enough to be used in technology?" I have been curious about this as someone who studies a field that is heavily reliant on programming languages. Gemini tells me that, "There's no formal process or organization that officially recognizes or endorses programming languages. However, a language can become widely accepted and used if it solves a real problem, it is easy to learn and use, it has a strong community, it is supported by tools and libraries, and it has real-world applications." This deviates from the topic of programming languages but the answer from Gemini reminds me of how many things in life do not have an "official stamp" for it to be wide respected in terms of its respective fields.

2. Curious to how a respected programming language came to be, I asked Gemini: "Can you give me an example of these steps with a language that has been created in the past and is now widely used?" Gemini responds with a bulleted list of how Python came to be: "Conceptualization, Syntax and Semantics, Compiler or Interpreter, Libraries and Tools, Testing and Refinement, and Community and Adoption." Gemini tells me that Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer, created Python in the 1980s with the goal of creating a programming language that is easy to learn for beginners. Adhering to its intended goal, Python's syntax is simple and readible. Python also does not require a compiler. Gemini's thorough yet short answer has allowed me to understand why Python has become so popular in just six or so bullet points.

3. I wanted to pivot the discussion a bit and ask an opinionated question to Gemini to see what kind of answer would be generated. "Should AI generated art be considered and judged the same as traditional art?" I asked this question because while AI relates to programming languages, I like how this question aims to connect to a seemingly oppisite audience of art. Gemini produced two answers, one for each argument:
    - Arguments for AI-generated art being considered the same: it possesses creativity, skill, and expression.
    - Arguments against AI-generated art being considered the same: it lacks a human element, intention, and ownership.
These answers from Gemini allow me to understand that many LLM have a responsibility to be unbiased and simple provide information. It makes me wonder if there are any LLM that are opinionated, and if they do not exist yet, could it be a possibility.

4. To continue my discussion with Gemini, I asked: "Do you have any academic references to support either side?" Gemeni recommended me these resources:
    - Supporting the Idea of AI-Generated Art as Equivalent to Traditional Art:
        - "The Creative Machine: AI and the Future of Art" by Paul Vickers: This book argues that AI can be a creative force, capable of producing original and meaningful art.
        - "Artificial Intelligence and the Philosophy of Art" by Stephen Davies: Davies explores the philosophical implications of AI-generated art and argues that it can be considered a form of artistic expression.
    - Supporting the Idea of AI-Generated Art as Distinct from Traditional Art:
        - "The Soul of the Machine: The Coming Age of Artificial Intelligence" by Arthur C. Clarke and Stephen Hawking: This book suggests that while AI can create impressive works, it may lack the human element that is essential to true art.
        - "The Future of Art: A Critical Anthology" edited by Michael Betancourt: This anthology includes essays on the nature of art and the potential impact of AI on artistic creation.

## TL;DR
1. **Question 1**: How do programming languages get created? And what makes them official enough to be used in technology?
    - **Gemini's Answer**: "There's no formal process or organization that officially recognizes or endorses programming languages. However, a language can become widely accepted and used if it solves a real problem, it is easy to learn and use, it has a strong community, it is supported by tools and libraries, and it has real-world applications."
2. **Question 2**: "Can you give me an example of these steps with a language that has been created in the past and is now widely used?"
    - **Gemini's Answer**: A detailed bulleted list about Python that focuses on "Conceptualization, Syntax and Semantics, Compiler or Interpreter, Libraries and Tools, Testing and Refinement, and Community and Adoption."
3. **Question 3**: Should AI generated art be considered and judged the same as traditional art?
    - **Gemini's Answer**:
        - Arguments for AI-generated art being considered the same: it possesses creativity, skill, and expression.
        - Arguments against AI-generated art being considered the same: it lacks a human element, intention, and ownership.
4. **Question 4**: Do you have any academic references to support either side?
    - **Gemini's Answer**:
        - Supporting the Idea of AI-Generated Art as Equivalent to Traditional Art:
            - "The Creative Machine: AI and the Future of Art" by Paul Vickers.
            - "Artificial Intelligence and the Philosophy of Art" by Stephen Davies.
        - Supporting the Idea of AI-Generated Art as Distinct from Traditional Art:
            - "The Soul of the Machine: The Coming Age of Artificial Intelligence" by Arthur C. Clarke and Stephen Hawking.
            - "The Future of Art: A Critical Anthology" edited by Michael Betancourt.

## Conclusion
Although having a conversation with a LLM is not the same as having one with another human, it does serve to help stimulate the brain in a similar way. I found myself generating more curiousities and questions as I asked the LLM more questions.
